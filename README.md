Not only this PCB but also a 16x2 LCD and a potentiometer (optimal 10k, but 1k should work, not less) are also needed.

**Motivation**

After buying a cheap chinese 16x2 LCD I realized that a lot of wire are need to connect, via breadboard, the LCD to the Raspberry Pi. That's why while learning to use Eagle I decided to design a PCB and print it at OSHPark.

**Contributors**

Everyone can contribute to this project, improving the code or adding functions. I will add, in the future, code for different plots and more examples.
